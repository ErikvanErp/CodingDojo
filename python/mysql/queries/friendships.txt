NINJA Query: Return all users who are friends with the first user, make sure their names are displayed in results.

NINJA Query: Find out who has the most friends and return the count of their friends.

NINJA Query: Return the friends of the third user in alphabetical order

Remark: The code below should be correct in principle, 
but in MySQL you cannot "yet" use LIMIT in a subquery

SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, 
friends.first_name AS friend_first_name, 
friends.last_name AS friend_last_name
FROM users 
JOIN friendships ON users.id = friendships.user_id
JOIN users AS friends ON friendships.friend_id = friends.id
WHERE users.id IN (SELECT id FROM users ORDER BY last_name LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2)
